# Examples

These examples are designed to illustrate how PyTorch-accelerated can be used in different contexts.

Example | Location | Description | Dataset
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
Train MNIST (Vision classification)| `core/train_mnist.py` | Demonstrates how to train a custom model using the default Trainer | MNIST (included with TorchVision)
Train Faster-RCNN (Vision object detection)| `vision/faster_rcnn` | Demonstrates how to create a custom Trainer for use with TorchVision's Faster-RCNN model | Cars (object detection)
